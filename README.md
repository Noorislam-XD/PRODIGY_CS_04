A keylogger is a software or hardware device that records the keystrokes a user types on a computer or mobile device. Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes: 
Malicious use
Cybercriminals use keyloggers to collect sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and websites visited. The keylogger then sends this information to a hacker who can use it to access secure systems. 
Legitimate use
Keyloggers can be used for parental supervision, employee monitoring, and troubleshooting: 
Parental supervision: Parents can use keyloggers to monitor their children's screen time and online activities. 
Employee monitoring: Companies can use keyloggers to track employee productivity. 
Troubleshooting: Information technology departments can use keyloggers to troubleshoot issues on a device. 
Some signs that a keylogger may be on your device include: a slow browser, a lag in mouse movements or keystrokes, and a disappearing cursor. 
You can also detect a keylogger by observing the performance of your device or whether someone else is trying to log in to your accounts.
